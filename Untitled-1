What is a Graph Database?
Connected information is everywhere in the world around us. 
Neo4j was built to efficiently store, handle, and query highly-connected data in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model, you can represent your real-world, 
variably-structured information without a loss of richness.




Ontology: 

a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.


now our core concept is match making, irrespective of domains, now the intelligence of our system partially 
depends upon this ontology, and the doamin we choose to work on is skills set of a both intra and inter comapany employees
in case u wanna change the domain , all u have to do is make an ontology by the specific doamin expert

now we have created 4 ontologies , the main one being skill  ontology 

[now i'll show the ontologiy and explain the nodes and partwholeof and same as relationships of skills 
and tiers of city, uni and company]

you can see all the skill nodes and their relationships, PART-WHOLE-OF relationship , now consider a person fills his 
profile saying he knows spring boot, now to the human understanding its obvious that he also knows java, meaning java is 
java is partwhole of spring boot, now this relationship depicts that, so when u search for a person who knows java, 
persons who java also comes up , in the same way, consider angular, we know html, css, js is partwhole  of angular and that 
angular is partwhole  of frontned technologies, so when the persons throws in a geniric search like "get me a front end 
developer" based on the ontology our search can produce results intelligently, 
its the same case with the relationship SAME AS, all the technologies which are same are connected throught this 
relationship for example both angular and angular 2 are same, 

now these same ontologies are used in autofill micro service, and 

when the indexer is indexing profiles, it is designed in a way that the newly genrated profile id is assosicated
pre existing nodes, this way a newly created node becomes a part of huge pre existing network making our search engine 
rich and intelligent
